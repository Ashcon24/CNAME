      <p><em>Aspiring <strong>Web developer</strong></em></i></p>
      <p> I am a self-taught web developer. I've been coding as a hobby for about 5 years, and now have experience in the languages
        swift, Python, Html, CSS and I am still learning more as the days go by.
        I began learning how to code in high school thanks to class I took in 2014
        but prior to forming a career in web development I've excelled at customer service, product sales, implementing medical ideologies, and using various types
        of POS systems while working in the Optical industry. The positions i've filled while in the industry are Optician, Ophthalmic Technician,
         Optical Lab Technician, and Patient Care Coordinator for telemed eye examinations. I am always learning new things and mastering new roles, now it's time to
         apply that ideology to finally starting my professional journey as a web developer.

         <h3><em>Work experience</em>:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Optician</li>
            <p>I began my professional journey as a Optician at <a href="https://local.lenscrafters.com/md/pasadena/8036-ritchie-highway.html?cid=yext_0169"> Lenscrafters</a> right out of high school.
             I was with this company a little over 4 years and learned quite alot during that time. Here I sold, fit, and measure glasses for customers, sold Contact lens based on perscription , 
             help patients choose the right materials, enhcnacments and treatment documentation for our patients as directed by the optometrist, as well as help "translate" peoples insureance options to them.
             Due to both the need of career growth and increased income I left lencrafters and floated around with new companies, both corprate and private. Corprate
             being more sales based and private being more care focused. I eventually decided that I wanted to explore different career options all together. 
            </p>
            <li>Ophthalmic Technician</li>
            <p>I started as an Ophthalmic Technician at <a href="https://local.lenscrafters.com/md/pasadena/8036-ritchie-highway.html?cid=yext_0169"><em>Lenscrafters</em></a>due to the immediate need of someone to fill the role. As a Ophthalmic Technician I would check-in patients, Verify Personal Information protected under
               <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/faq/187/what-does-the-hipaa-privacy-rule-do/index.html"><em>HIPPA</em></a>
              Check in with the optometrist/opthamologist, then proceed to Perform various tests on the eye to record results regarding the health of the eye as well as neurologic functions of how the brain should communicate with it. I learned alot at lenscrafters but I really got a deep understanding of it while I worked with a small private practice as a Technician and Optician.</p>
            <p><em>Test include but are not limited to</em>: 
              <ul>Autorefraction</ul>
              <ul>Visual Acuity</ul>
              <ul>Vision screening</ul>
              <ul>Stereopsis</ul>
              <ul>Binocular vision</ul>
              <ul>Visual field and so on </ul>            
              <ul></ul>
              <ul></ul>
              <ul> I still practice these skill as Patient Care Coordinator</ul>
              <br>             
             <li>Optical Lab Technician</li>
             <p>Like most of my other Optical skills, I started during my time at lenscrafters, but unlike being a technician, I started out of pure curiosity. I was always a fan of more settled/"focused" work. The lab workers would make magic happen while being in their own world,
               Meanwhile us Opticians/Techs would be running around like mad men trying to fill(and in a sense create) prescriptions in a timely accurate manner. Eventually I would start training in the lab there learning about the types of lens materials,
               coating, and machinery used to turn hockey puck size pieces of plastic (mostly polycarbonate) into tiny glasses lenses.
               However, even though the lab was its own element it was still hard fast-paced work. Customers need their Glasses as soon as possible and lab workers made that happen, all while being accurate and careful enough not to damage such sensitive products. 
               Once I left lenscrafters I found myself searching for Lab Work anywhere I could find it, when I started as a Optician at a private practice called <a href=https://severnaparkeye.com/””>Severna Park EyeCare</a>
              That's when I would learn alot about the logistic side of things; Pushing out manageable prescriptions,checking on expected arrival dates, keeping in touch with the patients about their glasses, and of course verifying that everything matches up before the patient even wears them.
               I left Severna Park Eye Care due to a job opportunity offering more money for my experience, and though that opportunity was not what I thought it would be, It did eventually lead me to working at a Manufacturing lab with one of the biggest lens manufacturers in the world Essilor-luxottica.
               Though I was here for a short period of time. I got to see how lenses were made from scratch and the process they go through before lab technicians at places such as Severna Park EyeCare and Lenscrafters even receive them.

            <li> Patient Care Coordinator</li>
              <p>When I started my journey to find more meaningful work I left the Optical field in general to discover what exactly in IT I had a passion for. I knew I wanted out of Optical but didnt know where to go, 
                so While I figured that out I did Uber Eats and Instacart full time.
                 That is, Until I got into a Car accident that totaled my vehicle. Now without income and after selling most of my devices in order to keep up on bill, I had to regroup. 
                Thankfully because of my prior experiences I was able to begin a New kind of role at a <a href="https://www.bjs.com/cl/pasadena/0059">BJ’s wholesale club</a>close by my home.
                 This is where I would use my past experience as Ophthalmic Technician and mix it with some skills I've gained while self-learning 
                IT techniques to become their new Patient Care Coordinator. As such, I would check-in patients, perform the same task I would as a technician except there would be no Traditional in person Doctor,
                 I would Connect us to a Certified Refractionist to perform task, then eventually, to a Licensed Optometrist to close the Examination. 
                I am currently still in this Role.
